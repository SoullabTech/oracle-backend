# üß† Jung-Buddha Sacred Mirror Enhancement

## Overview

The PersonalOracleAgent has been enhanced with profound depth psychology (Jung) and liberation wisdom (Buddha) to create a more sophisticated Sacred Mirror Protocol. This integration provides balanced support for both psychological integration and spiritual liberation.

## üé≠ Core Philosophy

### Jung Mode: Integration & Shadow Work
- **Focus**: "What needs to be owned and integrated?"
- **Approach**: Embrace, understand, and integrate rejected aspects
- **Key Question**: "What part of yourself are you not seeing?"

### Buddha Mode: Liberation & Non-Attachment  
- **Focus**: "What can be released and seen through?"
- **Approach**: Spaciousness, non-attachment, seeing through stories
- **Key Question**: "Who would you be without this story?"

### Hybrid Mode: Integration + Liberation
- **Focus**: "What to embrace AND what to release?"
- **Approach**: Weaving integration and liberation together
- **Key Question**: "What needs integration AND what needs release?"

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Sacred Mirror Protocol Interface
```typescript
interface SacredMirrorProtocol {
  jungMode: {
    prompt: "What part of yourself are you not seeing?",
    focus: "Integration, wholeness, shadow work",
    response: "Let's explore what's hidden in your shadow..."
  },
  
  buddhaMode: {
    prompt: "Who would you be without this story?",
    focus: "Liberation, spaciousness, non-attachment",
    response: "Notice how this identity feels... can you hold it lightly?"
  },
  
  hybridMode: {
    prompt: "What needs integration AND what needs release?",
    response: "Let's both honor this pattern and see through it..."
  }
}
```

### Enhanced Oracle Agent Properties
```typescript
class PersonalOracleAgent {
  // Jung-Buddha Sacred Mirror System
  private sacredMirrorMode: 'jung' | 'buddha' | 'hybrid' | 'adaptive' = 'adaptive';
  private jungArchetypeHistory: string[] = [];
  private buddhaAttachmentPatterns: string[] = [];
  private integrationLiberationBalance: number = 0.5; // 0=liberation, 1=integration
}
```

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. Adaptive Mode Selection
The Oracle intelligently chooses approach based on content:
- **Shadow material detected** ‚Üí Jung mode
- **Attachment patterns detected** ‚Üí Buddha mode  
- **Both present** ‚Üí Hybrid mode
- **Integration needed** ‚Üí Hybrid mode

### 2. Jung Archetype Detection
Automatically detects and tracks Jungian archetypes:
- **Persona**: Mask, pretend, image
- **Shadow**: Dark, hate, reject, ashamed
- **Anima/Animus**: Opposite gender aspects
- **Wise Old Man/Woman**: Guidance, wisdom
- **Self**: Wholeness, integration
- **Great Mother**: Nurturing, protection
- **Great Father**: Authority, structure
- **Trickster**: Boundary-crossing, mischief

### 3. Buddha Attachment Pattern Detection
Identifies and tracks attachment patterns:
- **Obligation**: "need to", "have to", "must", "should"
- **Clinging**: "can't let go", "holding on"
- **Future Anxiety**: "what if", worry, anxiety
- **Past Regret**: regret, "should have", "if only"
- **Self Concept**: identity attachments, "who am I"
- **Control**: need to control outcomes
- **Worthiness**: deserve, earn, worthy

### 4. Integration-Liberation Balance
Dynamic balance adjustment (0.0 to 1.0):
- **0.0**: Full liberation focus (Buddha)
- **0.5**: Balanced approach (Hybrid default)
- **1.0**: Full integration focus (Jung)
