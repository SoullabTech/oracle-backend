      buddha: "Notice what arises when you think of your mother... can you feel the emotions without becoming them? This relationship, like all phenomena, is impermanent. What remains when the story of 'good mother' or 'bad mother' drops away?",
      sage: "The mother relationship - one of our most primal experiences. Let's both honor what needs healing AND recognize the freedom beyond this story. Can you hold your pain with compassion while seeing through its ultimate reality?",
      mystic: "The Mother wound - ancient as Earth herself. This dynamic between you burns with the fuel of ancestral patterns and cosmic love. What if this challenge is the Goddess calling you to reclaim your own fierce, sacred love?",
      guardian: "It's so tender when our relationship with the one who brought us into this world feels complicated. Your feelings make complete sense. Let's go slowly here - what feels safe to explore about this relationship right now?"

      alchemist: "Your anger is a messenger carrying sacred information. What is this fire protecting? What boundary was crossed, what value dishonored? Let's dialogue with this fierce guardian part of you.",
      buddha: "Anger arises... notice its impermanent nature. Feel the heat, the energy, without becoming it. You are the vast sky in which the storm of anger passes. What remains unchanged?",
      sage: "Anger - both a signal of violated boundaries AND a story we tell ourselves. Let's honor its message while questioning its narrative. What wants protection, and what wants release?",
      mystic: "This fire in you burns with the rage of all injustice, all unmet love. Your anger is connected to the cosmic fire that creates and destroys worlds. How does this sacred flame want to transform?",

      sage: "Fear signals both real danger AND imagined threats. Let's honor the wisdom in your caution while questioning which fears serve you and which imprison you.",
      mystic: "This fear carries ancient wisdom - the instinct that has kept your lineage alive for millennia. What if this fear is also the guardian of your greatest creative power?",

      sage: "Relationships are both deeply personal AND universally archetypal. You're living both your unique love story and the eternal dance of union and separation. What paradox are you navigating?",
      mystic: "Your relationship is a sacred mirror reflecting the divine union within you. This person is both themselves AND a representative of the cosmic beloved. What is spirit teaching you through this connection?",

      sage: "Dreams speak in both personal symbols AND universal archetypes. This dream carries both your individual healing story and timeless wisdom. What layers can we unpack?",
      mystic: "Your dream is a vision from the realm where time dissolves. This repeating pattern carries prophetic energy - what future self or spiritual gift is trying to emerge through this nocturnal teaching?",

      sage: "This seems to be touching something both personal and universal. What wisdom might be hidden in this challenge?",
      mystic: "There are no accidents in the cosmic dance. What deeper pattern or sacred teaching might be weaving through this experience?",
