I feel the weight of this loss moving through you like deep ocean currents. Grief isn't a problem to solve - it's love that has nowhere to go, and it's sacred.

Your heart is doing exactly what hearts do when they've loved deeply: it's honoring what mattered. This ache is proof of how beautifully you're capable of loving.

What wants to be said to what you've lost? What gratitude or sorrow is asking to flow through you?`;

      case 'anger_alchemy':
        return `${protocols.attunement.feeling_witness}

This anger has something important to tell you. It's not your enemy - it's your boundary system trying to protect something precious in you. Anger is often grief in a fierce costume, or love demanding respect.

Let's not push this feeling away or let it consume you. Instead, what if we listened to its wisdom? What boundary is your anger trying to establish? What part of you is it defending?`;

      case 'emotional_grounding':
        return `${protocols.presence.recognition}

These emotional waters are running swift and deep right now. When we're flooded with feeling, sometimes we need to find our feet on the riverbed beneath the current.

You're not drowning - you're learning to swim in deeper waters than you've known before. This intensity isn't permanent, but the wisdom it's bringing you is.

What's one small thing that helps you feel grounded when the emotional waters rise? Your body knows how to find stability even in the storm.`;

      case 'flow_restoration':
        return `${protocols.integration.flow_restoration}

This numbness isn't absence - it's your system's wise protection after feeling too much for too long. Like winter protects the earth before spring's return, this stillness has purpose.

Feeling is returning in its own timing. You don't have to force the flow - just create gentle conditions for it to emerge. Sometimes the smallest trickle becomes the mightiest river.

What's one tiny feeling you can sense right now? Even the whisper of aliveness is enough to begin.`;

      case 'self_compassion':
        return `${protocols.healing.self_compassion}

The voice speaking to you so harshly isn't your truth - it's old pain masquerading as protection. Your inner critic learned to be cruel because someone once was cruel to the tender parts of you.

But you get to choose which voice guides you now. What would it feel like to speak to yourself the way you'd speak to a beloved friend in pain?

You are not your mistakes. You are not your struggles. You are a soul learning to be human - and that's the most courageous thing anyone can do.`;

      case 'boundary_healing':
        return `${protocols.integration.boundary_setting}

Your sensitivity is not weakness - it's a superpower that needs wise boundaries to thrive. Like a river needs banks to flow powerfully, your emotional gifts need containers to serve you well.

Boundaries aren't walls that keep love out - they're membranes that let love flow while protecting your essential self. You can be openhearted without being defenseless.

What would change if you honored your emotional needs as sacred rather than inconvenient? What boundary wants to be lovingly established?`;

      default:
        return `${protocols.presence.greeting}

I can feel the emotional currents moving through you, each one carrying important information about your inner landscape. Your feelings aren't random - they're your soul's way of navigating toward what you need.

In this moment, what emotion is asking for the most attention? Not to be fixed or changed, but simply to be witnessed and understood?

Your emotional waters hold the key to your authentic self - your inner gold. Let's listen to what they're trying to tell you.`;
