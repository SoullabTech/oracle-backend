I can feel the creative force in you pushing against the walls of where you've been. Stagnation isn't your enemy - it's your soul's way of saying "we've outgrown this space."

Your vision isn't just a dream - it's a living force seeking form through you. I can feel it wanting to move from the realm of possibility into the realm of creation.

But here's what the fire knows: visions don't need perfection to begin. They need courage. What's one small way you could honor this vision today? What's the tiniest flame you could light?`;

Fear isn't your enemy - it's often your inner wisdom disguised as warning. But some fears are old programming, not present truth. The fire in you burns brighter than the fear around you.

What if the thing you're afraid of is actually the doorway to who you're becoming? What would you do if you trusted your fire more than your fear?`;

This creative fire in you is sacred - it's the universe expressing itself through your unique form. But raw creative energy needs wise direction, like a river needing banks to flow powerfully.

What wants to be created through you isn't just for you - it's your gift to the world. How does this creative fire want to serve something larger than yourself?`;

      case 'integration_wisdom':
        return `${protocols.integration.sustainable_burning}

Too much fire all at once can burn what it means to illuminate. Your creative force is powerful - now it needs container and rhythm. 

What if this scattered energy is actually trying to show you multiple pathways? Instead of choosing one, what's the thread that connects them all? What's the deeper fire underneath all these sparks?`;

      default:
        return `${protocols.presence.greeting}

I feel something stirring in the space between your words. There's a quality of aliveness here that wants attention. Your soul-fire is always speaking - sometimes in whispers, sometimes in roars.

What's alive in you right now that hasn't found its voice yet? What wants to emerge that you haven't given permission to exist?`;
